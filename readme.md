# General Idea

The idea of this project is to develop a writting system, based on the latin alpabet, to write hebrew. The first intention is not to write biblical hebrew, but modern. Anyway, the idea contemplates the need for writing and reading ancient hebrew, mainly for non-hebrew speakers learning the scriptures.

This is not a phonetic attempt to write hebrew, it is a real writting system, with its own rules. The main goal of the whole projects is to make hebrew an easier to learn language and to even the difficulty levels of learning to speak and learning to write, something than in hebrew are much more apart than in other languages.

Hebrew is not a particullary difficult language to speak and to understand, but for non-isralies or non-religious jews, who learn it form a very early moment in their life, it is really diffcult to read and write. This happens because the full spelling has a vowelling system that does not represent the modern pronunciation, and the lack spelling has multiple consonants for making it more readable, heritages of biblical hebrew, but lacks from the majority of the vowels.

# The Alphabet

Each letter in the aramean or ancient hebrew alphabets has a corresponding latin letter, besides if it sound is usually written with two letters for phonetic porpuses (e.g.: ts or sh). The names of the letters are the hebrew ones, not the latin nor any latin-written language name.

| P         | p        | F         | f            |
| Ç         | ç        |
| Q         | q        |
| R         | r        |
| Ş         | ş        |
| Ṣ         | ṣ        |

## Consonants

There are 23 consonants in the alphabet, the 22 of the traditional alphabet plus one, because şin and ṣin are differentiated. Three letters have two different glyphs for the two sounds they represent, but they are not consider as six letters. Every glyph has just one sound.

Consonants are used only to represent consonantal sounds, they are never written to archive a vowel sound. If a word ends with an A sound it would never be written with a ending hei or alef. The same goes for the middle of the word with letters alef, yud and vav. There are exceptions for the above, they would be explained later.

There are not final consonants as in the aramean alphabet, the same glyph is used for any part of the word.

## The Vowels

The voweling system is built on top of the five latin vowels with their original sounds and similar to nowdays spanish, protugues or italian. The name of those letters are their own sound, as it is on those languages.
