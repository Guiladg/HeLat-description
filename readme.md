# General Idea

The idea of this project is to develop a writting system, based on the latin alpabet, to write hebrew. The first intention is not to write biblical hebrew, but modern. Anyway, the idea contemplates the need for writing and reading ancient hebrew, mainly for non-hebrew speakers learning the scriptures.

This is not a phonetic attempt to write hebrew, it is a real writting system, with its own rules. The main goal of the whole projects is to make hebrew an easier to learn language and to even the difficulty levels of learning to speak and learning to write, something than in hebrew are much more apart than in other languages.

Hebrew is not a particullary difficult language to speak and to understand, but for non-isralies or non-religious jews, who learn it form a very early moment in their life, it is really diffcult to read and write. This happens because the full spelling has a vowelling system that does not represent the modern pronunciation, and the lack spelling has multiple consonants for making it more readable, heritages of biblical hebrew, but lacks from the majority of the vowels.

# The Alphabet

Each letter in the aramean or ancient hebrew alphabets has a corresponding latin letter, besides if it sound is usually written with two letters for phonetic porpuses (e.g.: ts or sh). The names of the letters are the hebrew ones, not the latin nor any latin-written language name.

## Consonants

There are 23 consonants in the alphabet, the 22 of the traditional alphabet plus one, because Şin and Ṣin are differentiated. Three letters have two different glyphs for the two sounds they represent, but they are not consider as six letters. Every glyph has just one sound.

Consonants are used only to represent consonantal sounds, they are never written to archive a vowel sound. If a word ends with an A sound it would never be written with a ending hei or alef. The same goes for the middle of the word with letters alef, yud and vav. There are exceptions for the above, they would be explained later.

There are not final consonants as in the aramean alphabet, the same glyph is used for any part of the word.

Non-hebrew consonants are writen as in modern hebrew alphabet, with a gereş (apostrophe) after the letter, e.g. ç̕ips for the english word chips.

## Vowels

The voweling system is built on top of the five latin vowels with their original sounds and similar to nowdays spanish, protugues or italian. The name of those letters are their own sound, as it is on those languages.

# Rules of writting

## Baga"d Kapa"t

Bacuse in modern hebrew there is no disctintion in the pronunciation of the pairs T/Ŧ, D/Đ and G/Ǥ, they can be written with the ꜧazaq version. The other three pairs must be respected as they sound differs.

## Glottal stop letters

Alef is never written in words than start with it. Every word in hebrew that start with a vowel without any diacritical mark, is suposed to have a preceding Alef.

Diacritical marks over vowels are used to write the two glottal stop letter as part of a word. If Alef is muted it must be written as a circumflex accent (â) over the immediate previous vowel, if it is an Àyin, with a ring (å). When the glottal stop is pronounced it is written with an accute accent (á) for Alef and a grave (à) for Àyin.

For writting isoleted alef or ayin letters, the glyph that must be used is the regular one, diacritics must not be used outside of a word or unbinded from a vowel.

## Dissapearing letters

Diacritical marks below vowels are used to indicate the prescence of letters that are part of the root, but because those roots are weak, they are not always written in standard hebrew. Writing them, makes this system more regular, easier to understand, more accurate to actual pronunciation (dageş ꜧazaq is ommited when talking) and stop using consonants for vowel sounds (dipthongs are written with I not Y).

### Gizrat ꜦP"N

To this group belong the roots that have a Nun in the first radical and they lose it when conjugated. In standard hebrew, in those conjugations, the Nun dissapears and the second radical is written with dageş ꜧazaq.

Te way this Nun is written with latin letters is as a tilde below the first vowel before the second radical.

### Gzarot NPV"Y and NꙨV"Y

To this group belong the roots that have a Vav or a Yod in the first or the second radical. When conjugated they dissapear or the act as a vowel. They can make dipthongs too.

In latin letters, when they dissapear or sound as a vowel or a dipthong, Vav is written as a caron and Yod with an accute accent below the first vowel before the next radical or below the first vowel after the previous.

## Capitalization

-  The first letter of every sentence is capitalized.
-  The first letter of all proper nouns (names of people, cities, countries, places, etc.) is capitalized. If the name has more than one word, all of them are capitalized in the first letter (e.g. Tel AƂiƂ).
-  Titles are capitalized in every word.
-  Religious festivals and national holidays are capitalized.
-  Letter names are capitalized.

## Abbreviations

Abbreviations are written as in standard hebrew. Acronyms are written with gerşayim before the last letter (e.g. Ꜧ"K or T"Ʌ) and the optional adding of an A letter between consonants when they are traditionally pronounced (e.g. Tana"x or Raşla"ç). One word abbreviations are written with gereş after the last letter (e.g. Ad' or R').
